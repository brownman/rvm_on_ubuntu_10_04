# Important Notes
#   To install gems in rvm DO NOT USE SUDO! rvm sets up it's own environment.
#   If you have a better way, good for you. This is what works for me but by 
#      all means share.


Install required packages by running enclosed script
   
  ./install_packages.sh



Install rvm

   bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )

   
   
Install the readline package into rvm to fix error that occurs when running 'rails console'   

  rvm package install readline

  
  
Install ruby 1.9.2 under rvm with this option to avoid missing openssl library 
issues and follow subsequent installation instruction that will be shown
on the console screen

   rvm install 1.9.2 -C --with-openssl-dir=$HOME/.rvm/usr --with-readline-dir=$HOME/.rvm/usr


To get openvpn going create a directory in your home directory to store you vpn files,
cd into that directory and launch openvpn using the ovpn config file.
 
   mkdir ~/.openvpn
   cd ~/.openvpn
   openvpn --config countrystone.ovpn



Make sure to use ruby 1.9.2 and verify this is being used

   rvm use 1.9.2
   ruby -v
   
   
Inorder to get ruby-debug working in rails 3 when issuing 'rails server --debug' do the following.
Part A) Install these gems.

   gem install ruby-debug19
   gem install ruby-debug-ide19

Part B) Add this line to the Gemfile of any project you want to debug

   gem 'ruby-debug19', :require => 'ruby-debug'
   
   

Install bundler in case it's not installed. Note: Install gems WITHOUT sudo in order for them to
be installed properly in the rvm enviornment.

   gem install bundler



Change into your rails project root

   cd my_rails_project



Install required gems using bundler

   bundle install



Setup postgresql server if you need it.

    sudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER   # => creates a superuser account for your login
    sudo -u postgres psql
    postgres=# \password $USER                      # => create a password for you login 
                                                    # (use your login name rather than $USER)
